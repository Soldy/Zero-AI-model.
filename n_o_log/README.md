This is the model generation log. 
This log shows whether the generation process improves or not. 
Some of the data (like the 2026.01.31 memory usage) is incorrect. This is because this system is WIP at the moment.

# What a heck is NCC ?

NCC neural complexity count.
This is my own term to describe the covered information size. NCC can compare with a parameter; however, a 1000 NCC can equale with 100 or a million parameters.
Depend on the groups, levels, and jumps.
